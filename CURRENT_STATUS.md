   - Priority fix needed in input.tsx and dashboard/page.tsx

2. ⚠️ **Type Safety**: Address remaining TypeScript issues
   - Most critical in API routes and hooks
   - Using the created fix-typescript-safety.js script

3. ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Standardize error handling patterns
   - Create consistent approach across API calls
   - Improve user feedback on errors

4. ⚠️ **Data Fetching**: Standardize data fetching patterns
   - Consider implementing a custom fetching hook
   - Add proper loading and error states

## Next Priorities (2-Week Plan)

1. **Build Stability**: Ensure application builds and runs without errors
   - Fix remaining icon references and import issues
   - Resolve any environment configuration problems
   - Address critical TypeScript errors blocking builds

2. **Entity User Testing**: Complete testing with production credentials
   - Verify authentication flow works with live Monite API
   - Test webhook processing with production events

3. **UI Harmonization**: Finalize consistent UI across all dashboard sections
   - Apply clean aesthetic to remaining pages

   - Focus on type safety in API routes
   - Fix React hook rule violations
   - Address nullish coalescing issues in email system

## Development Guide

To make progress on the ESLint issues, use the following scripts:

```bash
# Apply ESLint overrides to make development easier
node scripts/apply-eslint-overrides.js

# Run ESLint with the overrides applied
./check-eslint.sh

# Fix common issues automatically
node scripts/incremental-eslint-fix.js

# Improve TypeScript type safety
node scripts/fix-typescript-safety.js
```

To run the development server:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
