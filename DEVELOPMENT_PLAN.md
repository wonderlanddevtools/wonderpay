# WonderPay Development Plan

## Project Overview
WonderPay is a B2B payment and working capital platform integrating Monite's API for financial automation, with features similar to Tola.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: NextAuth
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Payment Processing**: Monite SDK
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Completed Work
- **Next.js 14 Setup**: Project initialized with TypeScript and directory structure
- **UI Components**: GlowEffect and GlowButton components implemented for enhanced visual appeal
- **Landing Page**: Basic implementation with branded messaging and login/signup actions
- **Monite API Integration**: Started with token handling API route in `/src/app/api/monite/token/route.ts`
- **Core API Functions**: Created entity management functions in `/src/server/monite/monite-api.ts`
- **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment variables for Monite API credentials

   - Dark mode implementation

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Penetration testing
   - HSTS implementation
   - Rate limiting
   - Advanced fraud detection

4. **Production Readiness**
   - **Environment Switching**: Test the sandbox-to-production switch
   - **Configuration Validation**: Ensure all environment-specific settings transition correctly
   - **Deployment Pipeline**: Set up proper staging and production environments in Vercel
   - **Monitoring**: Implement production-specific monitoring and alerting

## UI/UX Excellence Plan

To achieve a design award-worthy product:

1. **Distinctive Visual Identity**
   - Build upon the existing fish logo and GlowEffect elements
   - Create signature animations for state transitions
   - Develop custom illustrations for empty states and onboarding

2. **Intuitive Financial Workflows**
   - Implement progressive disclosure patterns
   - Design clear information hierarchies
   - Create visualizations for complex financial data
   - Develop contextual help systems

3. **Emotional Design Elements**
   - Celebration animations for completed payments
   - Personalized user journey elements
   - Thoughtful empty states and error messages

4. **Industry-Leading Mobile Experience**
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Touch-optimized interactions
   - Native-feeling gestures and animations

## Sandbox-to-Production Considerations

Throughout all development phases, we will maintain a clear separation between sandbox and production environments:

- **Environment Variables**: Structured to easily switch between sandbox/production credentials
- **Feature Flags**: Implementation of toggles for features that behave differently in production
- **Testing Framework**: Tests that run against both sandbox and production APIs (with proper safeguards)
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of any differences between sandbox and production behaviors
- **Deployment Strategy**: Staged rollout plan to minimize disruption when transitioning to production

## Current Status

- **Phase 1**: In progress
  - Authentication partially implemented
  - UI components (GlowEffect) implemented
  - Landing page created
  
- **Next Steps**:
  - Complete the sidebar navigation
  - Finalize authentication flows
  - Set up protected routes
