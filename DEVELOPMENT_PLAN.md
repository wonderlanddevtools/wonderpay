   - Performance-optimized animations for mobile devices
   - Native-feeling gestures and animations

## Sandbox-to-Production Considerations

Throughout all development phases, we will maintain a clear separation between sandbox and production environments:

- **Environment Variables**: Structured to easily switch between sandbox/production credentials
- **Feature Flags**: Implementation of toggles for features that behave differently in production
- **Testing Framework**: Tests that run against both sandbox and production APIs (with proper safeguards)
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of any differences between sandbox and production behaviors
- **Deployment Strategy**: Staged rollout plan to minimize disruption when transitioning to production
